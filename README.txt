Welcome to Chmbrs NotePad
============================================== 
Thank you for taking the time to download and install Chmbrs Note Pad.

I am just a geek who wants to learn new things. I developed this small application just
for fun and to learn Android.
It has basically everything they suggest to have like Home Screen Widget, Live Folders,
Pin to Home, Notifications, Basic Preferences Settings. I tried to follow all their good practices in UI and code.

Version 0.1 Beta (05/19/2011):	
	* Basic features like, new, edit, update, delete Notes.
	* Set reminders in notes.
	* Add note to Google Calendar.
	* Custom Preferences.
	* Home Page Widget.
	* Live Folders.
	* Pin to Home.
	* Share Notes ( SMS, Google Voice SMS, FaceBook, Email, etc).
	* Export Notes to SD Card.
	
I will try to keep this project alive and add more things. I have a lot of ideas
I just need more time.

This is my personal blog I will try to add more help and documentation once the
application is in the Android Market.
